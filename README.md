# kapi-get-pair-info
Python (3.8) code retrieving and saving Pairs pricing and trading information from Kraken using kraken-api. This is a part of a dashboard (to be shared in future) I have been building to monitor assets trading.

This code is using Kraken API to retrieve and save trade info for a given pair every single minute:
- Open,High,Low,Close
- Trades
- Orders' depths
